        /// trying to steal. After a round of unsuccessfull stealing attempts, it blocks on the global queue.

        /// Each thraed pushes steps into its local queue. It sends a wakeup call to the global queue if
        /// at least one thread is waiting there.
        ///
        /// when all threads are blocking in the global queue, we know that no more steps are available for processing.
