       \brief CnC context bringing together collections (for steps, items and tags).
       
       The user needs to derive his or her own context from the CnC::context.
       The template argument to context is the user's context class itself.
       
       For example,
       \code
          struct my_context : public CnC::context< my_context >
          {
             CnC::step_collection< FindPrimes > steps;
             CnC::tag_collection< int > oddNums;
             CnC::item_collection< int,int > primes;
             my_context() 
                 : CnC::context< my_context >(),
                   steps( this ),
                   oddNums( this ),
                   primes( this )
             {
                 oddNums.prescribes( steps );
             }
          };
       \endcode
       
       Several contexts can be created and executed simultaneously.
       
       Execution starts as soon as a step(-instance) is prescribed through putting a tag.
       All ready steps will be executed even if CnC::context::wait() is never be called.
       
       It is recommended to declare collections as members of a context derived from CnC::context.
       This yields more maintanable code and future versions of CnC may require this convention.
